# Decentralized Energy Grid Management

A blockchain-based system for peer-to-peer energy trading and grid management, enabling direct producer-to-consumer energy transactions with transparent verification, tracking, and automated settlements.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized energy management system using blockchain technology to create a trustless, efficient marketplace for energy trading. The system consists of five core smart contracts that handle the entire energy lifecycle from production to consumption and payment.

## Key Components

### 1. Producer Verification Contract
Validates and registers legitimate energy producers on the network, establishing trust in energy sources.

### 2. Consumer Identity Contract
Manages secure consumer profiles with identity verification and energy usage preferences.

### 3. Production Tracking Contract
Records real-time energy generation data with immutable timestamps and source verification.

### 4. Distribution Contract
Efficiently allocates energy resources based on demand, proximity, and consumer preferences.

### 5. Payment Settlement Contract
Automates billing cycles and manages payments between producers and consumers.

## Features

- **Transparent Energy Trading**: Direct producer-to-consumer transactions without intermediaries
- **Real-time Tracking**: Immutable record of energy production and consumption
- **Automated Settlements**: Smart contract-based payment processing
- **Flexible Pricing Models**: Support for dynamic pricing based on supply, demand, and grid conditions
- **Decentralized Governance**: Community participation in decision-making for grid management
- **Renewable Integration**: Incentive mechanisms for clean energy sources

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum development environment (Truffle, Hardhat, etc.)
- Node.js (v14+) and npm
- MetaMask or similar wallet
- IoT device integration capabilities (for energy metering)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/decentralized-energy-grid.git
   cd decentralized-energy-grid
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile smart contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

4. Deploy the contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [your-network]
   ```

## Technical Architecture

The system utilizes a layered architecture:
- **Smart Contract Layer**: Core business logic for energy trading
- **Oracle Layer**: Connects real-world energy data to the blockchain
- **API Layer**: Interfaces for consumers, producers, and grid operators
- **Frontend Layer**: User interfaces for different stakeholders

## Use Cases

- **Residential Solar Producers**: Sell excess energy directly to neighbors
- **Commercial Buildings**: Optimize energy costs through direct purchasing
- **Microgrids**: Manage local energy distribution with greater resilience
- **Renewable Energy Farms**: Connect directly with environmentally-conscious consumers
- **Grid Operators**: Better balance supply and demand with real-time data

## Future Developments

- Integration with carbon credit systems
- Enhanced prediction algorithms for demand forecasting
- Multi-chain interoperability for cross-regional energy trading
- Mobile application for consumer energy management
